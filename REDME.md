I tried to keep solution as simple as possible. It contains two classes, Match and Scoreboard.
Because scoreboards are often divided into different
categories, for example "Premier League" and "Champions League",
I wanted to keep it as a class, which store assigned
matches. Class Match has all the rest required methods.
